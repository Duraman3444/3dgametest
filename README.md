## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `main.js` - Three.js scene setup and Socket.io client
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

## Socket.io Integration

The Socket.io client is set up but not connected by default. To enable multiplayer features:

## Building

To build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.
